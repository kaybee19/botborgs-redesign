This studio has released many games on web based platforms as well as Steam. After consulting with several studios we chose to go with this team because they have a ton of experience when it comes to WebGL open world type games which is precisely what we are doing here at Botborgs. This studio has also worked on several games with a futuristic space theme which is similar to what we are doing here at Botbrogs. The overall experience and past work of this studio spoke for itself which is why we chose it over several other teams that we interviewed.', img: game },
